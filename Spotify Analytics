# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First, I determined who the Top 10 artists are and what the track name based by popularity.
Select* From Spotifydata;
Select track_name, artist_name, popularity
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order by popularity desc
limit 10;

#Then I wanted to know what track and the popularity of a known artist called 'BTS'.
Select artist_name,Track_name,popularity
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where artist_name='BTS';

# Then I wanted to know the average danceability and average popularity.
Select artist_name,track_name, avg(danceability),avg(popularity)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name,track_name;

#Then I wanted to know which artist had the longest song and what was name of the track?
Select artist_name,track_name,duration_ms
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
Order by duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

# Finally I wanted to know the average danceability for the 10 most popular song.
Select artist_name,track_name
, avg(danceability)
,popularity
from bit_db.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
order by popularity desc
limit 10;
